title: 'Free-time Learning & Reading Plan'
pubDate: 2024-09-16
description: 'A post that will get updated over time listing my readings/learning goals starting from about 2023, hopefully correctly divided by subject.'

## Structure

I will try to divide the article by subjects:

* [Academic](#academic)
    * Physics & Maths
    * Computing
* [Professional](#professional)
    * Software Development
    * Rust Language
    * Product Management & Startups
* [Free-time](#free-time)

## Academic

My current "academic"-style learning goals are focused at the intersection between Physics & Computer Engineering.

After a classic Electromagnetism course, the paths start to diverge.


### Common start


* Physics I (Classical Mechanics) - [MIT OCW 8.01](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-01sc-classical-mechanics-fall-2016/) **COMPLETED**
* Physics II (Electromagnetism) - [MIT OCW 8.02](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-02-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-spring-2019/) **Up next: L24: Lenz's Law**

### Physics

* Differential Equations - MIT OCW
* Multivariable Calculus - MIT OCW
* Physics III - MIT OCW
* Classical Mechanics - Stanford Lectures by Susskind
* Something else by Susskind, Relativity / Quantum Mechanics
* Statistical Physics - Maybe MIT OCW, maybe book

Choose:
* Differential Forms
* Quantum Computing
* Non-linear Dynamics & Chaos
* Real Analysis Refresher

### Computing

* Circuits & Electronics - MIT OCW
* Computation Structures - MIT OCW
* Software Construction - MIT OCW
* Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach - Kurose & Ross **COMPLETED**
