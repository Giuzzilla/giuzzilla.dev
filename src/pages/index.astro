            I'm currently leading the Engineering team at Quick Algorithm, a
            startup working on Scops, a platform for advanced maintenance based

            My interests are at the intersection of Data-Intensive Web
            Applications, Cloud Architectures, AI Product Design & recently IoT
            (specifically LoRaWAN).

          <div class="bio-section hidden" id="tech-stack">
            I code mostly in Python in my day-to-day work (e.g. Airflow, Flask,
            FastAPI, various ML tools). I enjoyed trying out functional
            languages like Scala. Recently I'm working on some small projects in
            Rust.

            I recently graduated in a MSc in Computer Science at Georgia Tech,
            previously I did my BSc at Bocconi University (BEMACS).
